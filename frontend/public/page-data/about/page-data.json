I spent a lot of my teenage being the local tech-wiz in my neighborhood. I enjoyed being the one-stop solution for my family and friends - sometimes even friends of friends.\n\nAs I grew up, my passion for technology grew as well and I started learning how to code. Coding for me is a way to express my inner self as I’m not much of an extrovert and I like my actions to do most of the talking. I’m a self-taught programmer - my skill is purely driven by passion and I’m always challenging myself to learn new programming languages to feed my interest.\n\nI did my undergraduate degree in Business Administration and not in Computer Science because I felt I would lose my love for programming if I went through an undergraduate course where I would have to be focused on passing exams and GPA at all times. Technology is ever-evolving and there's always something new to learn every day that I didn’t want to limit by enrolling in a 4-year program. \n\nEven though I didn’t go through a formal Computer Science education I never stopped teaching myself different languages and challenging myself by applying them to make new web applications or websites. I took up many freelance projects to refine my skills and also to stay updated with what was new in the market. After graduation I did what I always loved, I took up a career in Information technology and have enjoyed the flexibility and learning opportunities that came with it. After having worked in this industry for 8 years in my home country - I moved to the UK in 2021, joined a leading edu-tech company called High Speed Training, and I have been working here since and presently as A Software Engineer 2. I know I made the right decision to pursue my passion and I’ve never regretted it.\n\nBesides computers, I am deeply attached to music. I was a Heavy Metal drummer and music composer when I was at University and also had a studio back in Bangladesh, where I had helped many artists record their music for their albums. Ever since I moved to the UK - I now satisfy my cravings to create music by recording Rumi’s poetry for my YouTube channel Inner Sphere. I make the videos and compose the music and currently have 58K+ subscribers.\n\nI’ve been told I’m a perfectionist when it comes to my work and has been loved by my peers at my previous workplaces. My work ethic has usually been appreciated and I like to think of myself as an efficient team player. I’m a simple person with a love for sophisticated technology.\n\nBelow are the few skills that I have acquired during my time working in the tech industry:","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.9803921568627451,"src":"/static/b17dc9f8aab3f00c8e864fa39f5e3ce6/14b42/ab4205dd31520ddd8610868892fdf290.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b17dc9f8aab3f00c8e864fa39f5e3ce6/f836f/ab4205dd31520ddd8610868892fdf290.jpg 200w,\n/static/b17dc9f8aab3f00c8e864fa39f5e3ce6/2244e/ab4205dd31520ddd8610868892fdf290.jpg 400w,\n/static/b17dc9f8aab3f00c8e864fa39f5e3ce6/14b42/ab4205dd31520ddd8610868892fdf290.jpg 800w,\n/static/b17dc9f8aab3f00c8e864fa39f5e3ce6/47498/ab4205dd31520ddd8610868892fdf290.jpg 1200w,\n/static/b17dc9f8aab3f00c8e864fa39f5e3ce6/0e329/ab4205dd31520ddd8610868892fdf290.jpg 1600w,\n/static/b17dc9f8aab3f00c8e864fa39f5e3ce6/43669/ab4205dd31520ddd8610868892fdf290.jpg 1960w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2874580956"]}
